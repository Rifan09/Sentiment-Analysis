## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that can predict the sentiment of text data, such as rating apps of Gojek. This project uses a combination of text preprocessing techniques and a machine learning and Deep learning model (such as LSTM, SVM) to perform classification.

### Features:
- Preprocessing text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Model training and evaluation.
- Prediction of sentiment on new text data.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
